# Description

This was the code for the FiftyTechFebruary bot. What follows was how the bot was used.

# The Fifty Technicals
The technicals were invisible. Contestants had to DM FiftyTechFebruary to find out what the fifty techs were.

The messages had a limit of 200 characters.

The goal of Fifty Tech February was undecided. However; locking all technicals was rewarded with a role.

## Locks

In order to lock a technical, it needed to have a message where it, and only it, was the most recent pass of the unlocked technicals. While this is theoretically possible by having a response that fits only one technical, in practice at the beginning it was done by passing all other common technicals in later technicals, leaving the one behind alone.
